            Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old bulbs

            work with you to design and install a system that uses solar, wind
            or geothermal that's guaranteed to wipe that power bill for now and
            into the future.

            Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is
            warmer than the air and we can use this to heat your home. HT Green
            can engineer a solution to fit your situation to give you free
            plentiful home warming energy year-round. Geothermal power is cost
            effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly, but has
            previously been geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate
            boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded
            the range and size of viable resources, especially for direct
            applications such as home heating. Geothermal wells tend to release
            greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions
            are much lower than those of conventional fossil fuels. As a result,
            geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming
            if widely deployed instead of fossil fuels

            If you have the space and the aspect, we have the know-how to
            engineer a wind turbine system that generates electricity when the
            wind blows. Team a wind turbine with a solar PV system and you
            increase your energy generation potential. New to wind power? HT
            Green can show you more about how a wind turbine works, the benefits
            of wind energy and how a wind turbine is installed. If you're not
            sure on the type of turbine you need, before you buy from us,
            contact one of our wind power experts for the right advice.
